This is an R data science project I completed in my coursework through CSU Global. In this assignment, I performed analysis work on a provided dataset pertaining to the Aimes, IA housing market. The included R script provides summary statistics, builds histograms, and creates a linear regression model to predict sales prices. The project repository includes the R script and testing/training CSV files.
